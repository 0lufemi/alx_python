# Python - Hello, World

0. Hello, print
Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
    * Use the function print
    ```
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/$ python3 0-print.py
    "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/$
    ```

1. Copy - Cut - Paste
Complete this 1-edges.py
    * You can find the source code 1-edges.py
    * You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
    * Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
    * ```word_first_3``` should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
    * ```word_last_2``` should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
    * ```middle_word``` should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters

    ```
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/$ python3 1-edges.py
    First 3 letters: Hol
    Last 2 letters: on
    Middle word: olberto
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/$ wc -l 1-edges.py
    8 1-edges.py
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/$
    ```

2. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

    * You can find the source code 2-pon.py
    * The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
    * You donâ€™t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code
    * The output of the program should be:
    * The number, followed by
        * if the number is greater than 0: ```is positive```
        * if the number is 0: ```is zero```
        * if the number is less than 0: ```is negative```
    * followed by a new line
    ```
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ python3 2-positive_or_negative.py
    -4 is negative
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ python3 2-positive_or_negative.py
    0 is zero
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ python3 2-positive_or_negative.py
    -3 is negative
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ python3 2-positive_or_negative.py
    -10 is negative
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ python3 2-positive_or_negative.py
    10 is positive
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ python3 2-positive_or_negative.py
    -5 is negative
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ python3 2-positive_or_negative.py
    6 is positive
    guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ python3 2-positive_or_negative.py
    7 is positive
